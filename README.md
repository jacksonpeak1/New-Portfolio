## Description
This was a difficult challenge, but I truly enjoyed the challenge of creating my first portfolio. My portfolio includes a top navigation bar with: my name, an about me, a work, a contact me, and a Resume button which was created with the unordered lists tags in HTML as seen in the header section. Upon clicking on each one of these links it will take you to that specific section of the website. I was also able to add a picture in the hero section by inserting the url link to  the picture within my css folder under the class hero. The About me section contains a picture of myself. My work section includes a picture of a game I created on the scratch website, as well as other placeholder pictures that will be replaced when I start creating more of my own applications. Additionally, my Contact me section contains my phone number, my email address and a link to my Github account.
